# Gender_Classification
This is a gender classification system based on five triditional algorithms.
 - The system is based on scikit-learn/pytorch from python.
 - The five algorithms are BP, Decision Tree, Minumum, Naive bayes and SVM.
 - Each algorithm involves application and improvement.
 - The file "rawdata" is the face images data (3991).
 - The text file "face.txt" is the label of each face images, which includes the gender, expression, age and so on.
   So if you want to put this system into classifying expression , age or other targets, you can change the label selection.
 - At last, thanks to Jingguo Chen(GDUT), Weiqian Lin(GDUT), Weiqun Lin(GDUT) and Dawei Yao(GDUT) for their joint efforts.
